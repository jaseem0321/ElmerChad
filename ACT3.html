    <h1>No Time To Pray</h1>
    <h2>By K. J. Koshy</h2>

    <p>I knelt to pray but not for long,<br>
    I had too much to do.<br>
    I had to hurry and get to work<br>
    For bills would soon be due.</p>

    <p>So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,<br>
    And jumped up off my knees.<br>
    My Christian duty was now done<br>
    My soul could rest at ease.</p>

    <p>All day long I had no time<br>
    To spread a word of cheer.<br>
    No time to speak of Christ to friends,<br>
    They'd laugh at me I'd fear.</p>
